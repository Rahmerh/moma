**Moma** is a Linux-first, CLI **mo**d **ma**nager.

It uses OverlayFS to layer mods cleanly on top of the base game folderâ€”keeping it untouched and easily reversible. Mods stay isolated and are only merged during runtime. A single unmount resets everything.

Moma avoids Windows-native tools like Mod Organizer 2 and fully embraces native Linux features. It's designed for minimal, terminal-driven modding without sacrificing control or flexibility.

## Usage

Moma is under active development. The current prototype is a Fish script. A full Rust rewrite is in progress.
